"**Synopsis**

An urgent message to reconnect with nature at every level, woven into the story of my lifelong journey of self understanding.

**Description**

While staying in the Lake District, I relived my journey through nature inspired by my feelings for the planet and our human predicament in these troubled times of global environmental and spiritual crisis.

Ancient wisdom saw nature as made of eight elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether, Mind, Wisdom and Ego. These elements are the substance of this world and the dress that we wear in our earthly incarnations. They range from physical to subtle, from visible to invisible.

Understanding these elements, experiencing and working with them in sacred awareness, transforms our lives. At this time all humans are called to choose how we wish to live; to choose between the paths of increasing light or the paths of sleep.

I share my personal realisations based on my work with yoga and ecology, wishing to inspire and encourage you on your personal spiritual journey.

Each chapter includes guided meditations and my own drawings."

"*'This is an amazingly wonderful text. Not because of the words in it, though Ranchor's writing is never less than beautiful, but because of the living presence that breaths, sings, weeps, laughs and dances through every page.'*
from the Preface by Jai Uttal

‘In this confused age the best spiritual practice is to chant the holy names of God,’ taught Sri Chaitanya. ‘Seek the company of devotees, and together chant Krishna’s names, then your love for God will grow and you will find lasting happiness.’

Five centuries after Chaitanya gave this simple and profound message to the world, his wisdom was carried to the West by my teacher, A C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in the form of the Hare Krishna movement. Following his inspiration, I have retold this wonderful story in simple language, based on the original biographies of Sri Chaitanya’s contemporaries."
